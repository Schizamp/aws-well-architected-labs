When a regional service event affects the Unicorn application in the primary region **N. Virginia (us-east-1)**, we want to bring up the resources in the secondary region **N. California (us-west-1)**.

We assume a regional service event has occurred. In this section, we will manually perform a series of tasks to bring up the application in the secondary region **N. California (us-west-1)**.  In a production environment, we would automate these steps using an AWS Cloudformation template or third-party tools. 

We will perform the following:
- Launch an EC2 instance from the AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- Restore the RDS database from backup
- Configure the application 

### Simulating a Regional Service Event

1.1 Navigate to [S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#/).

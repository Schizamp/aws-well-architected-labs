In this module, you will go through the Warm Standby Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy. To learn more about this DR strategy, you can review this [Disaster Recovery blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/).

Our test application is Unishop. It is a Spring Boot Java application with a frontend written using bootstrap.
The app uses an Amazon S3 bucket to host a static web interface. A single EC2 instance serves as a proxy for API calls to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database.  The database contains mock user and product information.

We will initially deploy the primary Unishop instance into the N. Virginia region.  Next, the N. California region will host the Warm-Standby DR instance.  To configure and deploy this infrastructure, we will use AWS CloudFormation.  CloudFormation enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation to quickly provision cloud resources.

Afterward, we will verify the DR scenario. Meeting our [RPO / RTO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html) _within minutes_ requires Amazon Aurora MySQL Clusters with the **1/** Read-Replica Write Forwarding and **2/** Amazon Aurora MySQL Global tables enabled. These features support replicating database changes from either region.

Prior experieince with the AWS Console and Linux command line are helpful but not required.
